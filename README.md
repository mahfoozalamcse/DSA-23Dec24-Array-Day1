# DSA-23Dec24-Array-Day1
🚀 50 Days of DSA & System Design Challenges: Day 1 Completed! 🔥

Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey of practicing 50 days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and System Design challenges! 🙌

💡 Day 1: Arrays (23 Dec 2024)
Challenges solved:
1️⃣ Search an element in an array
2️⃣ Insert and delete elements in an array
3️⃣ Rotate an array
4️⃣ Reverse an array
5️⃣ Solve problems using the sliding window technique
6️⃣ Calculate prefix sums in an array
7️⃣ Find the largest element in an array
8️⃣ Identify the second largest element in an array
9️⃣ Remove duplicate elements from an array
🔟 Move all zeros to the end of the array

Each problem came with its unique twist, teaching me to think more critically and optimize my solutions. It's amazing how these fundamental concepts can lay the foundation for solving complex real-world problems!

🔑 Key takeaway: Small, consistent steps lead to big achievements. Mastering the basics is the first step toward cracking advanced challenges.
